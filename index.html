<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 8, 2026</p>
<p>Collection Tracker ("we", "our", or "the app") is an Android application that helps users organize and track their personal collections. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use Collection Tracker.</p>
<p>By using Collection Tracker, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
<p>When you create an account or sign in, we collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> (for email/password authentication)</li>
    <li><strong>Google account information</strong> (email, display name, and profile photo URL when using Google Sign-In)</li>
    <li><strong>User ID</strong> (a unique identifier generated by Firebase Authentication)</li>
</ul>
<p>Account creation is optional. You can use the app without signing in, but cloud sync features require an account and a premium subscription.</p>

<h3>1.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
<p>The app stores content you create, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Collections (names, descriptions, cover images, display settings)</li>
    <li>Items within collections (names, notes, custom field values)</li>
    <li>Photos you take or import for items and collection covers</li>
    <li>Custom field definitions (field names, types, options)</li>
    <li>Sorting and filtering preferences</li>
    <li>Appearance settings (theme mode, custom colors)</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Purchase Information</h3>
<p>If you subscribe to Collection Tracker Premium, purchase transactions are handled entirely by Google Play. We receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Subscription status (active or inactive)</li>
    <li>Purchase tokens for validation</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect or store your payment method, credit card number, or billing address. All payment processing is handled by Google Play.</p>

<h3>1.4 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<p>The app includes Firebase Analytics, which may automatically collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>App usage data (sessions, screen views)</li>
    <li>Device information (model, operating system version)</li>
    <li>Crash and performance data</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is collected in aggregate and is not used to personally identify you.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide the app's core functionality</strong> — storing and displaying your collections, items, and images</li>
    <li><strong>Enable account features</strong> — authenticating your identity for sign-in</li>
    <li><strong>Sync your data across devices</strong> — for premium subscribers, securely syncing your collections, items, images, and settings via cloud services</li>
    <li><strong>Process subscriptions</strong> — verifying your premium subscription status</li>
    <li><strong>Improve the app</strong> — using aggregated analytics to understand usage patterns and fix issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

<h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
<p>Your collections, items, images, and settings are stored locally on your device in a private application database and file storage. This data is only accessible to the Collection Tracker app.</p>

<h3>3.2 Cloud Storage (Premium Feature)</h3>
<p>If you are a premium subscriber and signed in, your data is synced to the cloud using Google Firebase services:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Firestore</strong> — stores your collection data, items, field definitions, field values, sort presets, and appearance settings</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Storage</strong> — stores your item images, thumbnails, and collection cover images</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud data is stored under your unique user account and is isolated from other users. All data is transmitted using SSL/TLS encryption.</p>

<h3>3.3 Data Isolation</h3>
<p>Your cloud data is stored under your unique user ID and protected by Firestore security rules that prevent other users from accessing your data.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Collection Tracker uses the following third-party services, each governed by their own privacy policies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Analytics) — <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> (Sign-In, Billing) — <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with any other third parties. The app contains no advertising SDKs or third-party trackers.</p>

<h2>5. Permissions</h2>
<p>The app requests the following device permissions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Internet</strong> — required for account authentication, cloud sync, and subscription verification</li>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong> — to take photos for your collection items (optional; only used when you choose to take a photo)</li>
    <li><strong>Media/Photo access</strong> — to import images from your device gallery for collection items (optional; only used when you choose to import a photo)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

<h3>6.1 Local Data</h3>
<p>Your local data remains on your device until you delete it within the app or uninstall the app. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data, including the database and image files.</p>

<h3>6.2 Cloud Data</h3>
<p>If you used cloud sync, your data remains in Firebase until you delete it. You can delete your cloud data by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deleting individual collections and items within the app (synced deletions are propagated to the cloud)</li>
    <li>Deleting your account, which removes your authentication credentials from Firebase</li>
</ul>
<p>To request complete deletion of all your cloud data, please contact us at the email address below.</p>

<h3>6.3 Account Deletion</h3>
<p>You may delete your account at any time through the app's profile screen or by contacting us. Account deletion removes your authentication credentials from Firebase.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Collection Tracker is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete that information.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Access</strong> — you can view all your data within the app at any time</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion</strong> — you can delete your data through the app or by contacting us</li>
    <li><strong>Portability</strong> — your data can be exported via the app's CSV export feature</li>
    <li><strong>Correction</strong> — you can edit any of your data within the app</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
